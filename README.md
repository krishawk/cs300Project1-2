# cs300Project1-2

I ran into a problem with both of my projects. Project one had a lot of errors with the code setup. I am not very good at psueducode so I didnt 
do as good as I thought I did on it. On project two, I do have an error in the code and I am currently working on fixing that issue. 


I am trying to tackle the issue by applying a different approach to the code. Data structures are important to understand because of the design of algorithims. 


There have been a lot of road blocks while in my coding journey but the road block that I came across on the projects of this 
course were puesducodes and a class structure that I needed to use in my code. C++ is not the easiest language for me to learn but I am getting the hang of it.

I have signed up for the code games website and I am choosing C++ as the language to get better at, so I feel like having access to that website will help 
with my development of programs. I also think that I will take more time to learn code after this course when working on my own projects in the future.


This project has been the best project so far, I feel like I had more help with the code process when I got stuck.
