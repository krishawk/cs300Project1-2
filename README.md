# cs300Project1-2

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I ran into a problem with both of my projects. Project one had a lot of errors with the code setup. I am not very good at psueducode so I didnt 
do as good as I thought I did on it. On project two, I do have an error in the code and I am currently working on fixing that issue. 


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I am trying to tackle the issue by applying a different approach to the code. Data structures are important to understand because of the design of algorithims. 


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There have been a lot of road blocks while in my coding journey but the road block that I came across on the projects of this 
course were puesducodes and a class structure that I needed to use in my code. C++ is not the easiest language for me to learn but I am getting the hang of it.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I have signed up for the code games website and I am choosing C++ as the language to get better at, so I feel like having access to that website will help 
with my development of programs. I also think that I will take more time to learn code after this course when working on my own projects in the future.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has been the best project so far, I feel like I had more help with the code process when I got stuck.
